// This is a new file with the updated code.
// Since there was no existing code, the updates are directly applied here.

// Example of how the update might look in a larger context:
// const someVariable = 99.90; // Old value
const someVariable = 119.9 // Updated value

// The rest of the code would follow here, maintaining the structure and style.
